",Might or might not,"In order to provide the best possible help to an refugee/asylum seeker with mental health problems you need to be able to work with the person’s cultural
framework.
Be careful to respect the cultural traditions of the person, and not to dismiss or trivialise them.
When discussing mental health problems, be aware that a person may use alternative words to express their distress (e.g. using the word
‘nerves’ rather than ‘anxiety’) and that there might be a tendency for the person with mental health problems to present somatic complaints rather
than psychological ones","
Always communicate in a respectful way. Avoid using a raised voice with a person with low English comprehension, as this will not enhance communication.

If the person does not appear to understand, you should rephrase your statement in simpler words, avoiding jargon.

Always be aware of the surroundings and avoid having conversations in places that may trigger flashbacks and fearful reactions in the person (e.g. rooms with closed-in spaces or barred windows).
","
Cultural beliefs may also affect attitudes about treatments. For example some may have little knowledge or experience with psychotherapy as a treatment
option for mental health problems.

They may view reading the religious texts  as a helpful
intervention for mental health problems.

While culture and ethnicity are important, be cautious about attributing too much to them, particularly as there is a range of other factors that might affect the asylum seekers/refugees’ mental health (e.g. trauma and torture, experiences in their country of origin, settlement issues).

The influence of culture is two way. You also need to assess the potential influence that your own cultural values, expectations and attitudes can have
on the help you give to the person. 

For example, your confidence in Western approaches to health may lead you to overlook or dismiss alternative health beliefs that may be held by others"

2) Search for ways to make a connection with the person to try to create a context for a conversation;
3) Ideally have some knowledge of the person's culture of origin and the context from which they fled / left, and in more general terms the hazards of the journey they would have undertaken prior to the conversation if at all possible
4) Have acquired knowledge of the person's/community's cultural conception of mental health - how persons communicate distress;
5) Keep in mind that a person may have had to tell their story many times over and at times in hostile circumstances;
6) Keep in mind that it is more helpful to focus on the effects of what someone has experienced / endured than have someone recount what they have experienced;
7) Pay attention to mind-body connections. Asylum seekers often have problems with sleeping and eating due to patterns built up during their journeys and would benefit from collaboration around how to manage these;
8) Explore what has sustained the person throughout their experiences and try to identify with the person how they might continue to use these resources and build on them;
9) Find ways to enable a person to sustain their relationship with others. For unaccompanied minors these are often those with whom they have made the journey who have become like family;
10) Keep in mind that sometimes very brief mindfulness practices such as focusing on your breath while tracing your hand can help someone take some control of their panic or fear;
11) Realise / acknowledge that there are spikes of acute anxiety around asylum applications and accomodation issues;
12) Name injustices;
13) Always keep the context in focus;
14) Find ways to normalise responses to stress as some people carry a fear that they are going mad;

","Narrative-systemic, liberation psychology and social justice approaches have been helpful.",Definitely yes,"1) distress can take many forms which are different in different cultures
2) a sense of powerlessness is corrosive so if an asylum seeker can find a way to be effective in their own life even in a small way it can make a difference;
3) even short therapeutic consultations can be significant. It is important to notice and identify significant moments especially in an extremely stressful context of overwhelming need
4) it is crucial to think relationally and contextually
","1) work collaboratively with interpreters and asylum seekers;
2) follow an asylum seeker's feedback rather than your own 'plan' for a conversation;
3) work at many levels (body-mind-context) and try to keep these connected
4) become and stay aware of your own beliefs and assumptions to avoid imposing these on an asylum seeker
5) keep in mind the power inequalities in the relationship which cannot be erased but may be mitigated in the relationship in a number of ways
6) find ways in their personal-professional life to manage their sense of privilege which so often gets heightened in this work.","1) commitment to social justice and acknowledgment of the social injustices which the asylum seeker has experienced / is experiencing
2) willingness to discuss their work and its dilemmas with colleagues / supervisors and to stay open to discovering the assumptions they carry to avoid having these shape the work
3) ability to take care of themselves and see this as part of the work to sustain their capacity to do it
4) ability to identify why they want to do this work and to develop self-reflexivity in the work"
